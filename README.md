#3D scanning and calculation of intersections between 3D geometry and a plane

###Summary
3D scanning is the process of capturing the physical shape and dimensions of objects in the real world using specialized devices known as 3D scanners. The scanner emits signals (laser or structured light) and measures the time it takes for the signals to return. This data is used to create point clouds that represent the surface of the 3D model. The result of the 3D scanning process is a model that is saved in an STL file. STL is a file format used to represent a 3D model as a set of triangles. STL files can be in ASCII or binary format. Python code which is presented in this work is part of a larger system that can be used to analyze and visualize 3D models obtained by the 3D scanning process, especially in the context of how these models intersect with defined planes.
